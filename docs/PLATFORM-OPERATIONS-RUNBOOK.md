# NeurAI Platform — Operations Runbook

> **Purpose.** Everything needed to operate the deployed NeurAI Platform from a
> fresh machine: infrastructure map, access recovery, deploy/migrate
> procedures, and the hard-won gotchas. Lives in the repo on purpose — clone
> the repo on any machine and this comes with it. **No secrets are recorded
> here** (credentials live only in the encrypted secret store and the server's
> root-only env files); this file records *names, locations, and procedures*.

Last updated: 2026-08-19, after deploying the platform-root control plane.

---

## 1. Infrastructure map

| Piece | Where | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Web (UI + BFF)** | Vercel, project `mvp-web` | Public site `https://neurai.pt`. Reads the core base URL from server-only env `CORE_API_URL`. |
| **Core API** | Hetzner CX22, `178.105.251.216`, host `neurai-core-1` (Ubuntu) | Public entry `https://api.neurai.pt` via **Cloudflare Tunnel** → `localhost:8080`. Inbound: SSH only. |
| **Core services** | systemd, run as non-root `neurai` | `neurai-api.service` (:8080), `neurai-worker.service` (pgmq consumer), `neurai-ml.service` (:7801). |
| **Deploy dir** | `/opt/neurai/app` | The repo tree extracted from `git archive`. `node_modules` and `ml/models` are **not** in the archive (gitignored / untracked) and survive redeploys. |
| **Runtime** | `node --experimental-strip-types src/api/main.ts` | No build step — TypeScript runs from source. `node` v22 on the server. |
| **Env files** | `/etc/neurai/`, root-owned | `core.env` (api+worker, `root:neurai` mode `640`), `ml.env`, `env` (legacy copy). **Never print contents** — `grep -oE '^[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*=' core.env` lists the NAMES safely. The two database ones are **`DATABASE_URL_APP`** and **`DATABASE_URL_AGENT`**; there is no plain `DATABASE_URL`, and a probe that reads that name gets an empty string and connects to a local default — which answers ECONNREFUSED, or worse, answers. |
| **M5 env rung** | `WORKER_SUMMARY_MODEL` in `core.env` | The operator's model fallback (owner pref → org first choice → THIS → skip). Set 2026-08-27 (`google/gemini-2.5-flash`) after the P2 workflow acceptance found it EMPTY: a member with no preference in an org with no curation had no model at all, and the summarizer had been riding the higher rungs by luck. |
| **Database / Auth / Storage / queues** | Supabase (cloud) | Production and dev project refs are held in the DPAPI store and in `ECHO_DEV_PROJECT_REF`, not written here — a ref names a live endpoint. They are distinct projects. The server holds only the `echo_app`/`echo_agent` role URLs. |
| **Package manager** | pnpm `9.12.3` (pinned via `packageManager`) | Use `corepack pnpm@9.12.3`. |

Secret naming: every platform credential in the DPAPI store carries the
`echo_platform_` prefix; provider keys (`openrouter_key`, `soniox_key`) keep
canonical names. See `db/README.md`.

---

## 2. SSH access (and recovering it on a new machine)

Access is **key-only** for `root` (password SSH is disabled — `PermitRootLogin
prohibit-password`). A new machine has no key on the server yet. Recover it
without a password by one of these, in order of preference:

1. **Hetzner Console → reset root password**, then from your terminal:
   ```
   type <your_pubkey.pub> | ssh root@178.105.251.216 "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys && chmod 700 ~/.ssh && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
   ```
   (enter the shown password at ssh's prompt).

2. **`ssh-import-id`** — add your public key to a GitHub account, then in the
   Hetzner **web console** (root) run `ssh-import-id-gh <github-user>`
   (all-lowercase, GitHub is case-insensitive). Minimal typing — good when the
   web console's keyboard layout mangles symbols.

3. **Rescue mode** — Hetzner Server → Rescue → *Enable rescue & power cycle*
   with a selected key; boot in, mount the real disk, append the key to the
   system's `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`, reboot back.

> The Hetzner console "Add SSH key" dialog only affects **new** servers, not
> the running one — it is not a shortcut for the above.

Generate a fresh key per operator: `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/neurai_ops -N ""`.
Remove an operator's key from `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` when done.

---

## 3. Deploying a release to Core API

The deploy is a `git archive` extract — it replaces tracked files and leaves
`node_modules` / `ml/models` in place. From a clean checkout at the release
commit:

```bash
# 1. build the release archive locally and copy it up
git archive --format=tar.gz -o /tmp/rel.tgz <commit>
scp -i <key> /tmp/rel.tgz root@178.105.251.216:/tmp/

# 2. on the server: extract, normalize ownership, reconcile deps
ssh -i <key> root@178.105.251.216
  tar -xzf /tmp/rel.tgz -C /opt/neurai/app
  chown -R neurai:neurai /opt/neurai/app
  runuser -u neurai -- env CI=1 bash -lc \
    'cd /opt/neurai/app && corepack pnpm@9.12.3 install --frozen-lockfile --config.confirmModulesPurge=false'
  rm -f /tmp/rel.tgz

# 3. sanity: the new entrypoint parses under the production runtime
runuser -u neurai -- node --experimental-strip-types --check /opt/neurai/app/core/src/api/main.ts

# 4. activate (see §5 before restarting if the release needs a migration first)
systemctl restart neurai-api.service neurai-worker.service
```

**Order rule:** if the release adds a migration, apply the migration **before**
restarting (schema leads code). Additive migrations keep the old running code
working during the window.

Health after restart (from the server, no auth needed):
```bash
node -e "fetch('http://127.0.0.1:8080/health').then(r=>console.log(r.status))"
```
And publicly: `https://api.neurai.pt/health` → `{"ok":true}`.

---

## 4. Applying database migrations

Migrations need the **owner** connection (`echo_platform_db_url` in the DPAPI
store, or the production project's `postgres` connection string from the
Supabase dashboard → Settings → Database → **Session** connection, port 5432 —
*not* the transaction pooler 6543). The server holds only app/agent roles,
which cannot run DDL, so migrations run **from an operator machine** against the
cloud DB.

```bash
cd db
DATABASE_URL="<owner-connection>" node scripts/db.mjs migrate
```

Ledger table: `public.echo_migration (version, checksum, applied_at)`. The
runner refuses to change an already-applied file (append-only).

### Two gotchas that will bite you (both hit during the 2026-08-19 deploy)

1. **CRLF vs LF checksums.** Production recorded migration checksums from an
   **LF** checkout. A Windows working tree is usually **CRLF**, so `db.mjs`
   reports `0001_foundation.sql changed after it was applied` and refuses.
   Fix: run against **LF** copies of the migration files —
   ```bash
   for f in db/migrations/*.sql; do tr -d '\r' < "$f" > "$f.__lf" && mv "$f.__lf" "$f"; done
   # …run migrate…
   git checkout -- db/migrations/     # restore the working tree afterwards
   ```
   (The real cure is a `.gitattributes` pinning `*.sql` to LF, or a
   normalize-on-read in the runner — not yet done.)

2. **`check_function_bodies` / Supabase.** Some migrations create
   `security definer` functions with `set search_path = ''`. Supabase's own
   migration path runs with `check_function_bodies = off`; `db.mjs` does not,
   so the DB validates those bodies at creation and can fail (e.g. an extension
   type like `citext` is unreachable under an empty search_path). Apply with a
   session that turns it off — via the connection string, **no persistent
   config change**:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL="<owner>?options=-c%20check_function_bodies%3Doff" node scripts/db.mjs migrate
   ```
   And **qualify extension types** used inside `search_path = ''` bodies
   (`public.citext`), or give that one function `set search_path = public`
   (all `echo.*` refs stay qualified). See migration `0067` for the pattern and
   `db/DECISIONS.md`/`0045` for the rule.

---

## 5. Platform-root bootstrap (M32) — claiming the first operator

Platform Root is a **platform-operator** role beside the org hierarchy. It sees
only lifecycle metadata (orgs, user statuses, a metadata-only platform audit
log) and may suspend/reactivate orgs, enable/disable non-root users, and
grant/revoke other roots. It has **no** access to calls, transcripts,
summaries, assistant conversations, prompts, API keys, or connectors — the org
RLS wall is unchanged. Schema: `db/migrations/0066` (+ `0067` fix), routes
`/v1/platform/*` in `core/src/api/server.ts`, UI at `web` `/[locale]/platform`.

**The bootstrap selector** names the one active account allowed to claim the
first root. It is a **temporary server-only setting, not a secret and not a
password**:

```bash
# add (append-only; preserve owner/mode), then restart
printf 'PLATFORM_ROOT_BOOTSTRAP_EMAIL=%s\n' '<account-email>' >> /etc/neurai/core.env
chown root:neurai /etc/neurai/core.env && chmod 640 /etc/neurai/core.env
systemctl restart neurai-api.service
```

Flow: the operator signs in normally → opens `https://neurai.pt/fa/platform` →
sees **“Claim platform root”** → claims it. The DB function
`echo.bootstrap_platform_root` verifies the session actor's email equals the
configured selector and that no operator exists yet, then inserts the row and
writes a `root_bootstrapped` audit line.

**After the claim succeeds, remove the selector** (it has done its job; leaving
it is unnecessary):
```bash
sed -i '/^PLATFORM_ROOT_BOOTSTRAP_EMAIL=/d' /etc/neurai/core.env
systemctl restart neurai-api.service
```
Further roots are granted in-product by an existing root (`platform_grant_root`),
never via the env selector again.

---

## 6. Vercel (web) configuration

The web app must know where the Core API is:

- **Set** `CORE_API_URL = https://api.neurai.pt` for the **Production**
  environment. **Server-only — do NOT use `NEXT_PUBLIC_CORE_API_URL`** (that
  would ship the internal base URL to the browser; `web/src/server/core.ts`
  reads `CORE_API_URL` server-side).
- **Redeploy** production from `main` so the new value takes effect.

Dashboard: Vercel → project `mvp-web` → Settings → Environment Variables → add
for Production → then Deployments → Redeploy (or push to `main`).

---

## 7. Deployment record — 2026-08-19

- Deployed core release **`16ff16a`** ("Add privacy-preserving platform root
  control plane") to `/opt/neurai/app`; `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`
  (464 pkgs); entrypoint parses under `--experimental-strip-types`.
- Applied migrations **0065, 0066** (production was at 0064) plus a follow-up
  **0067** fixing `bootstrap_platform_root`'s `citext` resolution (commit
  `3e70eac`). Ledger now at `0067`.
- Appended `PLATFORM_ROOT_BOOTSTRAP_EMAIL=neurai.git.acc@gmail.com` to
  `/etc/neurai/core.env` (perms preserved `root:neurai 640`) and restarted
  `neurai-api` + `neurai-worker`.
- Verified: `https://api.neurai.pt/health` → 200; `/v1/platform/access` →
  401 (route exists, was 404 pre-deploy); an invented route → 404 (control).
- **Root claimed** by `neurai.git.acc@gmail.com`; the bootstrap selector was
  then **removed** from `core.env` and `neurai-api` restarted
  (`/v1/platform/bootstrap` now returns 404 — the door is closed; the operator
  row persists in the DB). `CORE_API_URL=https://api.neurai.pt` was set on
  Vercel and the web redeployed.
- **Console made fully operable** (commit `8267b18`): every control (org
  suspend/reactivate, user disable/reactivate, grant/revoke root) has its own
  confirm-and-reason dialog; tabbed Organizations/Users/Audit; overview,
  filters, humanized metadata-only audit log. Privacy boundary unchanged.
- **Follow-up owed:** apply `0067` to the **dev** database too (its `0066`
  bootstrap function has the same latent citext bug); consider a `.gitattributes`
  LF pin for `db/migrations/*.sql` to end the CRLF checksum friction.

---

## 7b. Deployment record — 2026-08-20 (console edit + soft-delete/restore)

Feature commit **`c26344a`** ("Add edit + soft-delete/restore to the
platform-root console"). Shipped a metadata edit + 7-day soft-delete/restore
for orgs and users, entirely inside the M32 content wall.

- Applied migrations **0068** (soft-delete columns on `echo.org`/`echo.app_user`
  + six new `platform_audit_action` enum values) and **0069** (six
  `security definer` functions: `platform_update_org`, `platform_update_user`,
  `platform_soft_delete_org`, `platform_restore_org`, `platform_soft_delete_user`,
  `platform_restore_user`; executable to `echo_app` only). Ledger now at `0069`.
  Migration run by the user with the Session/owner connection (LF-normalize +
  `check_function_bodies=off` per §4). **Verified** against the production
  catalogue as the `echo_app` role: 6/6 columns and 6/6 functions present.
- Deployed core `c26344a` (git-archive → `/opt/neurai/app`, `chown`,
  `--experimental-strip-types --check` on `main.ts`). **No `pnpm install`**:
  no dependency/lockfile change in the range, so `node_modules` was untouched;
  only `neurai-api` restarted (`platform.ts`/`server.ts` are api-only).
  **Verified:** `/health` 200; the four new routes (`DELETE`/`POST …/restore`
  on org + user) return **401** (wired behind auth) not 404, on localhost and
  publicly via `api.neurai.pt`.
- Pushed `c26344a` to `main`. **Web did NOT come up:** the production alias
  `mvp-web-beta.vercel.app` returned **`DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND`** before and after
  the push (polled ~6 min, never recovered). A `git push` cannot take a site
  down, so the alias was already detached from a live deployment. Resolve in the
  Vercel dashboard: confirm the GitHub→Vercel auto-deploy of `main` produced a
  production deployment from `c26344a`, then ensure `mvp-web-beta.vercel.app` is
  assigned to it (Project → Domains), or use whatever URL the project shows as
  **Production**. No Vercel CLI/token exists on the operator machine — this step
  is dashboard-only.
- The backend feature is fully live regardless of the web alias; once web serves
  again, hard-refresh `/fa/platform` to see Edit / Delete (7-day) / Recently
  deleted + Restore on both tabs.

---

## 7c. Deployment record — 2026-08-20 (tenancy-audit hardening)

Four-pass multi-tenancy audit (db/RLS, core, web, docs): **no cross-org data
path found at any layer**; the user re-affirmed one-org-per-user (recorded in
ARCHITECTURE.md M2). Hardening shipped:

- **db/0070** — `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` on `echo.platform_operator` +
  `echo.platform_audit` (the only two tables missing it; db/test/50's
  every-table tripwire demands it and had not been run since 0066 landed).
  Owner-connection migration — apply per §4.
- **core** — agent tools now run on `echo_agent` via `agentToolsDb`
  (identity.ts; explicit app-role requests fail loudly, no actor-less door);
  **proven against the production catalogue**: every tool-path table +
  `fa_fold` OK as echo_agent, `connector_secret` refused (42501) as the
  negative control. `/v1/admin/server` queue depths are platform-root-gated
  (deployment-wide counts are a cross-tenant activity signal; org admins get
  a named refusal). Worker now REQUIRES `DATABASE_URL_AGENT` (fallback to the
  app URL removed — the api's refuse-to-boot posture, adopted).
- **web** — `setPreferredModel` swapped to the live `PUT /api/models`;
  caller-less fixtures `agentRuns`/`correctLine` DELETED (tenant-identical
  fabrications; correctLine reported a correction saved that no server ever
  received); the client's last mutable fixture state (`me`/`users`/
  `transcripts`) removed with them; sign-out sweeps `neurai-draft-*` from
  sessionStorage so a half-typed question can't reach the next account on
  the same tab.

Remaining from the audit, deliberately NOT built (user's scope ruling):
multi-org membership (declined for v1), per-org quotas/usage view, billing,
custom domains, compliance-grade deletion. Self-serve signup unblock =
Supabase dashboard work (custom SMTP + Site URL), tracked separately.

---

## 7d. Deployment record — 2026-08-20 (auth flow, history, org workflows)

Commits `f3b234b` + `1c8a81c`. Migration **0072** applied (org-authored
workflows: org_id/created_by on workflow_template, tenant-scoped read
policy, admin-gated insert). Reset/invite completion now ends at the
SIGN-IN form (no auto-session — user ruling); invited arrivals register
server-side during reset. History delete works (the archive BFF hop
existed nowhere); session lists carry message_count. Hub composer's Tools
menu removed. Create-workflow shipped end to end.

Test residue erased: both test identities removed product-side via
`db/scripts/erase-user.mjs`
(owner-run; savepoint-per-delete catalogue walk; accepts emails or raw
UUIDs — an email lookup misses TOMBSTONED rows) and then auth-side via the
admin API (verified 0 matches). Note: the walk deletes RESTRICT-referencing
rows, so two platform_audit lines about the test users went with them —
acceptable for test residue, would not be for a real account.

Supabase dashboard config the flows depend on (user-side): Auth → Email
Templates must link Invite → `{{ .SiteURL }}/fa/reset?token_hash={{ .TokenHash }}&type=invite`,
Reset → same with `type=recovery`, Confirm signup →
`{{ .SiteURL }}/api/auth/confirm?token_hash={{ .TokenHash }}&type=signup`;
Site URL = `https://app.neurai.pt`. Custom SMTP still pending for volume.

---

## 7e. Deployment record — 2026-08-21 (the AI-native shift, Phases A–D)

Commits `72000d4`→ (Phase A) → `630894f` (B) → `2a23db6` (C) → Phase D.
M33–M36 ratified in ARCHITECTURE.md; full plan + deferrals in
docs/AI-NATIVE-PLAN.md. Shipped: client tools (the agent drives the
surface — start/pause/resume recording, navigate, open, search — under
the user's own session with consent cards), the presence dock (orb on
every route, Ctrl/⌘-K, daily continuous thread, page context), the
autonomy dial (watch/assist/act + org ceiling), signals (post-call brief
+ weekly digest as cards→conversations, run AS the owner), reasoning
traces, the Assistant-activity governance card, generative answer
blocks, and read-aloud.

**PENDING MIGRATIONS on production: 0073, 0074, 0075** (owner-run, the
§4 procedure). Until they land, core capability-detects and degrades
loudly: dial = assist for everyone (boot log names 0073), signals
skipped with a warn per message (0074), ceiling uncapped (0075). After
migrating, RESTART api + worker — the capability cache clears on boot.
Verify: the api boot log's `capability_missing` line disappears.

Deferred with reasons (see the plan doc): realtime STT proxy (live
catch-me-up + translation lane — the Soniox key must never reach the
browser), wake word (explicit opt-in UI first), Act for server
proposals, model-composed briefs.

---

## 7f. Deployment record — 2026-09-15 (the other machine's tree lands: c39a8a3)

Commit `c39a8a3` is the whole tree built on the other PC, applied on top of
`05fe3e4` as ONE commit (382 files: 99 added, 258 modified, 22 deleted, 3
renamed — the dashboard and the old meeting stage removed on purpose). Vercel
built the web from the push at once; core and ml were deployed by this
procedure four hours later, from the Asus laptop — whose server key is
`~/.ssh/neurai_claude`, not `neurai_hetzner` (§2: the key is a property of
the machine).

**Schema first, and it was already done.** Production's Supabase project is
the one this laptop's `.env` names (`icnbeprlqqjojwjzjdgj`), so the owner
connection for §4 was at hand — with one trap: its password contains `#`.
Node's `--env-file` cuts an unquoted value at `#` (48 characters arrived of
111), and `repair-ledger-0154.mjs` hands the URL to `pg` raw, so the scripts
were driven through a small loader that reads `.env` whole and percent-encodes
the password exactly as `db.mjs`'s `normalizeDbUrl` does (there is no
`.env.dev` on this machine; that is the file the seed/repair scripts look for).
  1. `node db/scripts/repair-ledger-0154.mjs` → `renamed
     0132_the_sweeps_get_their_indexes → 0154_…` — the ledger still held the
     file under its old number; without it `migrate` re-runs the file and
     fails on indexes that already exist.
  2. `node db/scripts/db.mjs migrate` → applied 0218–0222; ledger 222 rows.
  3. `node db/scripts/db.mjs test` (fixture-only, nothing dropped) → 71
     files, 1007 checks, all PASS — "the wall holds".

Then §3 exactly: `git archive` of c39a8a3 (24.6 MB; sha256 `6190f903…`
identical on both ends) → extract over `/opt/neurai/app` → chown →
`pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` (3.2 s; the only new packages are the
web's `react-markdown`/`remark-gfm`) → `api/main.ts` AND `worker/main.ts`
parsed with `--experimental-strip-types --check` → ml rebuilt with
`node node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc -p tsconfig.json` and the emitted
`dist/src/config.js` checked for the new marker (`int(90 * 60 * 1000)`
present, the old 35-minute one absent — the 2026-09-10 rule: read the
artifact, never the exit code) → restart ml, api, worker. No env name is new
since 05fe3e4, so `core.env` was not touched. Health 200 after 1 s; ml's
health names `sherpa-eres2netv2`; the worker started at concurrency 2; zero
level≥40 lines in the three journals afterwards.

**The discriminating pair at three altitudes** — on the server, through
`api.neurai.pt`, and through `app.neurai.pt`'s BFF: `/v1/platform/demo-orgs`
**401** beside `/v1/nonsense` 404 and `/v1/me` 401; on the BFF
`/api/platform/demo-orgs` 401, `/api/nonsense` 404, an empty POST 400. Before
this deploy the same route answered 404 at every altitude, which is exactly
what the platform console's «not found» on «Create demo organization» was:
the web had shipped ahead of the server, and a no-such-route nothing reads
as a no-such-feature nothing from a browser.

Not done here, on purpose: the demo seed itself was not pressed (it writes
an organisation into production — the operator's button).

## 7g. Deployment record — 2026-09-15, evening (6a36862, core only)

No migration in this release, so §5 does not apply and §3 ran straight
through. Archive 24 587 280 bytes, sha256 `4e88c6ae…`, **compared on both
ends before extracting** — the cheap half of "verify the artifact, not the
command that made it". `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` reported the lockfile
up to date and nothing to do (this release touches no dependency), both
entrypoints passed `--experimental-strip-types --check`, then
`systemctl restart neurai-api.service neurai-worker.service`. ml was not
rebuilt: nothing under `ml/` changed.

**Markers checked on disk before restarting**, because an extract that lands
in the wrong tree restarts cleanly and changes nothing (the 2026-09-06
`/opt/neurai` vs `/opt/neurai/app/core` lesson): the navigate enum has zero
occurrences of `"/search"`, and `client-tools.ts` carries the new comment.

After: both units `active`, `/health` `{"ok":true}`, no level≥40 journal lines
in the minute after the restart, and the pair at the server altitude —
`/v1/me` **401**, `/v1/assistant/sessions/<uuid>/messages` **401**,
`/v1/nonsense` **404**.

**Order note worth keeping:** this release REMOVES a client tool
(`set_search`) whose executor the web had already dropped. Core was deployed
as soon as Vercel's build went green rather than left for later — a core still
advertising a tool the browser cannot run is the same seam as a web ahead of
its server, pointed the other way, and the model would have called it.

---

## 7h. Deployment record — 2026-09-15, night (5971511 + 7747e93: M54, db/0223)

A migration first (§5): `0223_a_person_arrives_into_their_own_workspace`
applied from this laptop through the `.env` loader (the `#` in the owner
password — see 7f) — its self-checks ran on production and rolled their probe
back; then the fixture-scoped suite against production: **72 files PASS, "the
wall holds"**, 127 at 20 checks against the live door. Read afterwards at
owner altitude (counts only): 3 orgs, all `team`; no intake org marked
(= B2C mode); 14 active humans and 6 agent seats backfilled as onboarded, the
2 disabled accounts not; both new triggers present; neither new definer door
executable by PUBLIC.

Then §3 for core at 7747e93: archive 24 642 612 bytes, sha256 `5dc55de4…`
equal on both ends; markers on disk before restarting (`/v1/me/onboarding`
×1 in server.ts, `hasOnboarding` ×3 in members.ts); `pnpm install` had
nothing to do; both entrypoints parse under strip-types; both units `active`,
`/health` `{"ok":true}`, no warnings in the minute after; the pair at the
server: `PATCH /v1/me/onboarding` **401**, `/v1/me` **401**, `/v1/nonsense`
**404**.

Web on Vercel from the same push. Probed from outside: `/fa/sign-up` 307 →
`/fa/sign-in`; `/fa/onboarding` signed out 307 → sign-in; `POST
/api/auth/otp` with a malformed address 400 `invalid` (GoTrue's own
sentence, nothing created), with no body 400 `bad_body`; `POST
/api/auth/otp/verify` with an invented address 401 `invalid`; `PATCH
/api/me/onboarding` signed out 401 against `/api/nonsense` 404. In the
user's Chrome, rendered text (script text rejected, catalogue-only control 0):
the gate is one email field with «ادامه» and «ورود با گذرواژه» and nothing
else; on Home the first-run door opened for the owner with its five choices,
«همین حالا امتحان کن» / «بعداً», no `<video>` and the «coming soon» line.

**Operator step outstanding:** the Supabase Magic Link template
(docs/ONBOARDING.md §5). Until it is changed, the mail carries neither our
link nor the code — the gate is correct in code and unreachable in
configuration.

## 7i. Deployment record — 2026-09-16 (28af01e: four doors, the verification wall, db/0224–0225)

Migrations first (§5), both from this laptop through the `.env` loader (7f):
`0224_a_workspace_is_verified_before_its_agents_spend` (the column and its
backfill, `register_account` rebuilt with a NULL founding stamp, the
`agent_run` trigger, `platform_set_org_verified`, `platform_list_orgs`
DROP+CREATE with `verified_at`) and `0225_the_gate_learns_apple_microsoft_and_sso`
(the `signin_method` check widened, three rows OFF). Self-checks ran on
production and rolled their probes back. The fixture suite's FIRST run
against production failed two files, neither about these migrations:
`65_signin_methods` asserted `count(*) = 2` on a table that now holds five,
and `40_purge` asserted `count(*) = 1` on the purge role — which is
actor-independent and sees the whole database's expired calls: ONE real
call (a failed take soft-deleted 2026-08-17) crossed its window at 00:04 UTC
today, after the nightly `neurai-purge.timer` last ran (03:39 UTC 09-15,
`callsPurged: 0`) and before its next sweep (03:37 UTC today). Nothing is
wrong with the purge; the tests were counting. Both assert the property now,
and the re-run reads **"the wall holds"** — 128 at 14 checks against the
live door, 40 at 23, 65 at 10. Read afterwards at owner altitude (counts and
switch names only): 3 orgs, all verified with `verified_at = created_at`;
the trigger present; the trigger function, `platform_set_org_verified` and
`platform_list_orgs` not executable by PUBLIC; `platform_list_orgs` carries
`verified_at`; `signin_method` reads google/github on, apple/azure/sso off.

Then §3 for core at 28af01e: archive 24 677 747 bytes, sha256 `eb75a866…`
equal on both ends; markers on disk before restarting
(`core/src/agent/verification.ts` present, `setOrganizationVerified` ×1 in
platform.ts, `SIGNIN_METHODS` ×2 in vocabulary.ts, `assertOrgVerified` ×5 in
server.ts); `pnpm install` had nothing to do; both entrypoints parse under
strip-types; both units `active`, `/health` `{"ok":true}`, zero level≥40
journal lines in the minute after; the probes at the server: `POST
/v1/assistant/ask` **401**, `PATCH /v1/platform/organizations/x` **401**,
`GET /v1/nonsense` **404**.

Web on Vercel from the same push (`fra1`, live at 00:51 UTC: `GET
/api/auth/sso` **405** where `/api/nonsense` 404s — the route is POST-only,
and 405 is the not-404 that says it exists). From outside: `POST
/api/auth/sso` with `{"email":"example.com"}` → 400 `code: disabled` (the
switch is off — the sentence, never a provider page); with no usable field →
400 `invalid`. The gate, signed out, in the built-in browser at 1280 (the
first JS read came back at vw 0 — a hidden pane lays out at zero; re-read
right after a screenshot): `<html dir="rtl">`, the split grid `dir="ltr"`
(1084 wide, display grid, 2 children), the FORM on the right at 721–1113 and
the demo section on the left at 98–629, buttons «ادامه با گوگل / اپل /
مایکروسافت / ورود سازمانی (SSO)», «یا», an email input, «حساب دارید؟ با
گذرواژه وارد شوید», zero `<video>` (no demo URL set — the scenes cycled
between two screenshots), catalogue-only control 0. In the user's Chrome,
signed in, 1280 with the assistant open: **meetings** — rows at 72 and 122
and the folder strip THIRD at 173 wearing the tinted rail
(`FILTER_TRACK`), «همه جلسات ۰», the dashed `+` labelled «موضوع جدید», the
page's only combobox the top-bar search (the topic dropdown is gone); the
org has no meeting folder, so a chip's ⋯ could not be read there — it was
read on **tasks**, the SAME component: «دیتابیس صوتی ۰» carrying its ⋯
(«گزینه‌ها») beside «پوشهٔ جدید» and «پروژهٔ تازه»; **projects** — the
rail reads home / meetings / **projects (182) / tasks (235)** top to bottom,
no integrations entry; the toolbar's tracks are the board's; «پروژهٔ جدید»
absent on the kanban (the columns' «افزودن پروژه» rows are the door) and
present on the list view as `.btn btn-primary` — at 1280 with the assistant
open row one WRAPS (three tracks) and the end slot lands at y=166; through
the 1920 iframe instrument (root 16.34) it sits in row one at y=80, 601–707,
39px tall, at the row's end; **home** `/fa?view=integrations` — the sidebar
«گفت‌وگوها» lists «عامل‌ها» at 133 and «اتصال‌ها» directly under it at 170
(`aria-pressed` true), the pane 13 tiles / 6 «متصل است», the verification
banner ABSENT with both controls («اتصال» on screen 1, «تأیید دسترسی
دستیارها» catalogue-only 0); **profile** — «خروج از حساب» is a `btn btn-sm`
pill with its glyph at 422–538 on the row-one line (top 75, 32px, = the
menu's tabs), in its own end track at 419–542 flush with the column's end
(the menu track sits at 806–1188), zero danger buttons; **console** — three
«تأییدشده» chips, zero «در انتظار تأیید», three kebabs.

**Operator steps outstanding:** (1) the Supabase Magic Link template
(docs/ONBOARDING.md §5) — unchanged from 7h; (2) Apple, Azure and SSO exist
as doors on the gate and as switches in Settings · Sign-in methods, all OFF
until the provider is configured in Supabase Auth and the switch flipped —
a press on an off door answers a sentence, never a broken redirect;
(3) `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_VIDEO_URL` in Vercel turns the gate's left half from
the illustrated scenes into the demo video; (4) a workspace founded through
the gate is born UNVERIFIED — its agents refuse (403 `org_unverified`, the
banner on Home) until the platform root presses «تأیید دسترسی دستیارها» in
the console; the three existing organisations were backfilled verified.

## 7j. Deployment record — 2026-09-16, later (ec45c44: web only — the language into Settings, Persian default, the org form, the boards' rows)

No migration and no core change: web on Vercel from the push (`Vercel – mvp`
success on the commit status; the signed-in probe below is the deploy
marker, since the settings page had two cards before it). Signed out from
outside, a bare `/` with `Accept-Language: en-US` → 307 `/fa/sign-in` (our
gate's own spelling, true before and after). **In the user's Chrome, signed
in, whose browser asks for English (`navigator.languages` = en-US, en)**:
`https://app.neurai.pt/` lands on **`/fa`** — the default is Persian for a
browser that would have been sent to /en before this deploy. The top bar's
end cluster reads bell · chat · theme with **zero** fa/en buttons. Settings ·
General: three cards «پوسته», «زبان رابط», «تاریخ و زمان»; the language
select reads «فارسی», the zone select **«تهران»** (was `Asia/Tehran`); the
clock at the date card's other end read «۲۵ شهریور ۱۴۰۵ · ۰۵:۱۰:۱۶» and two
seconds later «… ۰۵:۱۰:۱۸», on the title's line (tops 382 / 379) at the
row's end (424–572 against the title at 1105–1172, RTL). Management ·
General: the labels in document order are «نشان سازمان», «نام سازمان»,
«ایمیل», «وب‌سایت», «زبان پیش‌فرض سازمان»; the inputs are org-name,
org-email, org-website; no «توضیح», no «مکان», no «رایانامهٔ عمومی» anywhere
on the page. Profile: zero `<dl>`, zero `.tile`, the identity form present.
Tasks at 1280 with the assistant open (main 1212): row one's three rails at
y=72 (231 / 267 / 238 wide), row two's tinted rail at y=122 **356 wide** —
it had spanned the column — inside a `flex-wrap` row. Projects: row one's
two rails at 72, row two's tinted rail at 122, 338 wide, in a wrap row, its
items `tab:پروژه‌های من`, `tab:همه پروژه‌ها`, `button:مهلت امروز`. Security:
ten session rows; the device column reads «اج» for the Edge session and
«مرورگر» for the unbranded ones, with no Latin on the page but colleagues'
names and a username. NOT read live: the zone dropdown's option labels —
the tool's click did not hold the Radix panel open for a read; the
`GeneralSettings.test` case pins every option Persian.

## 7k. Deployment record — 2026-09-16, later (65a3f30: web only — the buttons take the rail's box, the meetings sort joins row one and the search becomes a key, Help leaves the rail, «ذخیره», the voice picker creates nobody)

No migration and no core change: web on Vercel from the push (`Vercel – mvp`
success on the commit status). **In the user's Chrome, signed in, at 1280
(root 15.06)**, the meetings page: row one is TWO grey rails at y=72 — the
slices «گذشته / پیش‌رو / آرشیو» and the sort, a `tablist` labelled
«مرتب‌سازی» with `data-key` date · people · status — and the lit pill in
either reads 32px tall, a 16px corner, weight 500; the two buttons at the
row's end, «جلسه جدید» (`btn-primary`) and «جلسه پیش‌رو» (`btn-secondary`),
sit at y=72 at **39.5px, 16px, 500** — the pill plus the track's padding
(34 + 8 at that root = 32 + 7.5), which is the one family the ruling asked
for (they had measured 35.8 / 11px / 600 beside a 39.5 rail). Row two at
y=122: the strip's tinted rail — «همه جلسات ۰» lit (32 / 16px) and the
dashed `+` «موضوع جدید» (26.4px on an 8px corner) — inside a
`flex flex-wrap items-center justify-between` row, and at the row's other
end ONE tinted track: «فهرست» (pressed), «تقویم», and the search key
«جست‌وجوی جلسه» (`aria-pressed` false), each 32px. Pressing the key:
`aria-pressed` true, ONE `<input>` inside that same tinted track, focused,
32px tall and 181px wide in a 12rem wrapper, the track 114 → 295px. Typing
«جلسه» → the field reads it. Pressing the key again → `aria-pressed` false
and ZERO inputs; pressing it once more → the field comes back EMPTY (the
query cleared on close — the assertion that matters). The rail reads
«خانه · جلسات · پروژه‌ها · تسک‌ها · مدیریت · تنظیمات» and no «راهنما».
Management · General: the labels in document order «نشان سازمان», «نام
سازمان», «ایمیل», «وب‌سایت», «زبان پیش‌فرض سازمان»; the page's only buttons
are «فارسی» and **«ذخیره»** (39.5 / 16px / 500); the rendered-text walk
finds no «ذخیرهٔ تغییرات» (with the catalogue-only control at 0). NOT read
live: the search narrowing rows (this organisation has no meeting, so the
empty state stood under the field) and the voice picker (no record with
speakers on it) — both pinned by their unit tests. Probe note: a synchronous
read in the same JS call as a `.click()` sees the state BEFORE React's
flush (the key read "not pressed, no input"); the read in the next call
saw the field. Read after the click, never beside it.

---

## 7l. Deployment record — 2026-09-16, last (035926b: web only — the projects page takes the board's two rows)

No migration and no core change: web on Vercel from the push (`Vercel – mvp`
success on the commit status; the deploy marker is the strip itself, which
the page did not have before). **In the user's Chrome, signed in, at 1280
(root 15.06), /fa/projects**: row one is THREE grey rails at y=72 inside one
wrap row — the views (231px wide), the sorts (270px), and the toggles
(212px) holding «پروژه‌های من» and «مهلت امروز», each 32px, `aria-pressed`
false at rest; ZERO `.btn-primary` above y=150 (the row-one create is gone);
the kanban's four columns keep their «افزودن پروژه» rows. Row two at y=122:
the strip's tinted rail, **316px wide** in a `justify-between` wrap row (its
content, not the column): «همه پروژه‌ها ۱» lit, the chip «📁 دیتابیس صوتی»
carrying a ⋯ labelled «گزینه‌ها», and the dashed `+` «پروژهٔ جدید» (26.4px).
The ⋯ opens two entries, «ویرایش» and «حذف» (the second in the danger
coat); «ویرایش» opened the project's own panel — a `role="dialog"` headed
«دیتابیس صوتی» at **`/fa/projects?project=30ae8ef4-…`** — and Escape closed
it back to `/fa/projects`. Pressing «پروژه‌های من»: `aria-pressed` true,
the pill lifted (`bg-surface` + `shadow-card`), the one card stayed (the
reader is on that project) while the strip's count stayed «۱» (the strip
lists every project; the toggle filters the cards); pressed again → false.
NOT pressed live: «حذف» (it deletes a real project) and the `+` (it opens
the create dialog; pinned by the unit test as opening the dialog and not
the inline box).

---

## 7m. Deployment record — 2026-09-16, later (f525157: db/0226 project folders, core + web — the attendees row, the folders' strip, the picture control, the column slot)

**Schema first (§3's order rule).** 0226 was applied to the throwaway
Postgres on this laptop and the SQL suite run there (129 PASS with 16
checks; 102 purge coverage, 109 the set-null class and 30 the agent wall
all PASS; the two `auth.sessions` files are the recorded local-shim reds),
then to PRODUCTION through the `.env` runner (`applied 0226_a_project_
sits_in_a_folder.sql`) with the suite after it («the wall holds»). Then
core: `git archive` of f525157, sha256 `654cc88537629c26` equal at both
ends, `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` («Done in 1.7s»), both entrypoints
parse under `--experimental-strip-types`, `server.ts` on disk names
`projects/folders` three times, both units `active`, health
`{"ok":true}`; the altitude probe on the server reads **401** on
`/v1/projects/folders` and `/v1/me` against **404** on `/v1/nonsense`;
zero warning-level journal lines in the three minutes after the restart.
Then the push: `Vercel – mvp` success on the commit status.

**In the user's Chrome, signed in, at 1280 (root 15.06).**
`/fa/projects`, kanban: row one three grey rails at y=72 (231 / 270 / 212
wide — views, sorts, the two toggles at rest); row two the tinted rail
**160px wide** at y=122 holding «همه پروژه‌ها ۱» (lit) and the dashed
«پوشهٔ جدید» — NO chip named after a project, NO «پروژهٔ جدید» button,
four «افزودن پروژه» rows in the columns. «لیست» pressed: «پروژهٔ جدید» is
`.btn btn-primary` at 39.5px / 16px in row one's end slot (top 119: the
slot wrapped to a second line at this width with the assistant open, the
kit's own rule), the strip still there, zero column rows. `/fa/meetings`,
«جلسه جدید» pressed: the dialog's field order is «عنوان جلسه *» ·
«موضوع (پوشه)» · **«شرکت‌کنندگان»** · «نحوهٔ برگزاری»; the attendees box
opens with the HOST row «دکتر باقری · میزبان (شما)», nine colleague rows
each `aria-pressed="false"`, the guest field «نام مهمان…» at 32px and its
«افزودن» key; closed, «جلسه پیش‌رو» pressed: one dialog titled «جلسه
پیش‌رو» with the same host row, nine colleagues and the guest field beside
its two date/time inputs. `/fa/management/general`: the logo (45px at
950,137) wears a 26px camera badge at its lower corner (948,158) named
«تعویض تصویر» and a 26px trash beside it (913,147) named «حذف»; the file
input is still the row's labelled control («نشان سازمان», type file); the
page's buttons are exactly «تعویض تصویر», «حذف», «فارسی», «ذخیره» — no
retry glyph, no «انتخاب تصویر», and none of those words as rendered text.
`/fa/profile`: the photo (45px at 950,137), its badge «تغییر عکس» at
(948,158) and its trash «حذف عکس» at (913,147) — the SAME numbers as the
logo's, which is what "so they become the same" measures as; no «حذف عکس»
text on the page. `/fa/tasks`: the lane's children are four `<section>`s
of 185px and nothing else, `scrollWidth === clientWidth` (773 = 773); the
only dashed controls outside the columns are the strip's own «پوشهٔ جدید»
and «پروژهٔ تازه».

NOT pressed live (writes on the organisation's data): a folder's create,
rename or archive, a project filed into one, a meeting created with
attendees, a photo or logo changed or removed. Each is pinned by its unit
test and by the verify-red mutations of the round.

---

## 7n. Deployment record — 2026-09-16, last (7c2673e: web only — the attendees dropdown, the circle, the composer's row)

No migration and no core change: web on Vercel from the push (`Vercel – mvp`
success on the commit status). **In the user's Chrome, signed in, at 1280.**
`/fa/meetings`, «جلسه جدید» pressed: the dialog carries TWO comboboxes,
«موضوع (پوشه)» reading «بدون موضوع» and «شرکت‌کنندگان» reading «دکتر
باقری» — both `.input`, both **37.6px** tall on an **11px** corner, and the
attendees box has ZERO `aria-pressed` rows of its own (it was nine an hour
earlier, which is the shape the directive replaced). Opening the attendees
control: a listbox with `aria-multiselectable="true"` and ten options, the
first «دکتر باقری — میزبان (شما)» carrying `aria-disabled="true"`. Pressing
the first colleague: the panel **stayed open**, that row went
`aria-selected="true"` with a check glyph, and the closed control then read
«دکتر باقری، Behnaaz Behjati». Escaped without creating anything.
`/fa/management/general`: the logo computes `border-radius: 9999px` at
45×45 — the profile photo's own numbers, and the class list reads
`rounded-full`. The assistant sidebar's composer row has exactly two
children: `type="submit"` with the enter glyph at the row's start (left 340
on the RTL row) and the mic with `ms-auto` at its end (left 18), with no
`[data-icon="plus"]` anywhere in the row.

NOT pressed live: creating the meeting (a write on the organisation's data),
and the mic itself (it opens the microphone).

---

## 7o. Deployment record — 2026-09-16, later (54b442f: web only — the films just play, the two reveals wear the questions' anatomy, the first-run door stays shut over its lesson)

No migration and no core change: web on Vercel from the push (`Vercel – mvp`
success on the commit status, four polls). **In the built-in browser pane,
signed OUT, at 1280×720** — the gate is the signed-out screen, and the user's
Chrome holds the owner's session, which the gate routes home. `/fa/sign-in`:
the `<video>` reads `controls: false` (no `controls` attribute in the DOM),
`muted: true`, `loop: false` (the carousel), 486×364; the section under it
carries exactly ONE paragraph (the film's sentence, «دربارهٔ جلساتت سؤال
بپرس…») and the five chips «جلسات · دستیار · کارها · تیم شما · اتصال‌ها».
The caption «ویدیوهای نمونهٔ ۱۰ ثانیه‌ای · دادهٔ فرضی · بدون صدا» is absent
from the RENDERED text (SCRIPT/STYLE/TEMPLATE rejected) and from the flight
payload too — its key left the catalogue — with the two controls that make
the reading evidence: an on-screen string («عضویت در نورای») found, a
catalogue-only string («حذف اتاق») not found. Playback with no chrome: the
film was 8.8 s in and `paused: false` on one read, and 2.5 s later the
element carried `/demo/fa/tasks.mp4` — it had reached its end and advanced
to the next clip on `ended`, having already stepped from `meeting` to `ask`
while the probe was set up.

NOT read live, and why: the two onboarding screens (the flow refuses a
member whose stamp is set — the owner's is — and a fresh sign-up is a write
on production) and the first-run door's remount (the owner's `firstRunSeen`
is already true, so the door does not open for them). Both are pinned by
tests with the production-shaped fixture; the screens reuse the exact split
frame the four question pages render live.

---

## 7p. Deployment record — 2026-09-16, later (447a371: db/0227 the task's room and the project reach, core + web — M55)

Migration first (schema leads code), then core on Hetzner, web on Vercel.
0227 applied on production and the fixture suite re-run — 75 PASS, "the wall
holds", 130 (32 checks) and 106 (18) among them. Core: archive hashes equal
end to end (`ff31674…`), both entrypoints parse under strip-types, both units
active, health `{"ok":true}`, zero level≥40 journal lines after; the room
route reads **401** at `/v1/tasks/:id/room` against `/v1/nonsense` **404**.
Web built from the push (`Vercel – mvp` success on the first poll); the BFF
pair discriminates — the room route **401** unauthenticated, `/api/nonsense`
**404**.

**Read on production in the user's Chrome, at 1280.** The meetings ⋯ menu is
**142px** wide (its longest entry «انتقال به موضوع»), not the old 13.5rem
floor; opening «انتقال به موضوع» drew the flyout at **136px** BESIDE it
(both panels `parentIsBodyChild`, `ancestorClips` empty — portaled, nothing
clips them), and three hit-tests across the flyout's own rect all landed
INSIDE it, where before only a 12px sliver did. The task detail's rail
carries «اتاق گفت‌وگو» as a combobox reading «اتاقی ندارد» at 38px, in order
موضوع · وضعیت · مسئول‌ها · **اتاق گفت‌وگو** · اولویت · مهلت · برچسب‌ها, with
«اتاق تازه» (`btn btn-sm btn-secondary`, 32px) beside it — the owner's
control. Projects: the owner sees «۱۰۰ ساعت …» (created by an admin, Sina)
at «همه پروژه‌ها» with its trash, and pressing «پروژه‌های من» flips it
`aria-pressed=true` and HIDES the card — the owner is not on that one
project, which is «mine» working from an admin's seat (the bug was the
toggle emptying the page).

NOT exercised live, and why: putting a task in a room, «اتاق تازه», and the
seating (a write on the org's data, the 2026-09-06 lesson); the positive
half of «mine» for an admin (the org has one project and the owner did not
make it — pinned by projectReach's unit matrix and db/test/130 instead).

## 7q. Deployment record — 2026-09-17 (7c9f5ee: db/0228 the letterhead, core + web — the صورت‌جلسه, the company sheet, the agent's two halves)

Migration first (schema leads code), then core on Hetzner, web on Vercel.
0228 applied on production and the fixture suite re-run there — «the wall
holds», with **131_letterhead (14 checks)** among them; locally the same file
was flipped twice and went red by name. Core: archive hashes equal end to end
(`b708e64fe9a03c2a`), both entrypoints parse under strip-types, both units
active, health `{"ok":true}`, **zero** level≥40 journal lines after. Web built
from the push and read with a cache-buster **100s** later.

**The route probe needed correcting mid-flight, which is the point of having
one.** `GET /v1/admin/org/sheet` answered **404** where I had predicted 401 —
that route is POST/PATCH/DELETE only, so Fastify was right and the probe was
asking the wrong question. Asked properly: `POST`, `PATCH` and `DELETE` on
`/v1/admin/org/sheet` and `POST /v1/meetings/:id/minutes-text` all **401**,
`GET /v1/org/sheet` **401**, against `POST /v1/nonsense/sheet` **404**.

**And the Vercel probe was vacuous on its first run, for a new reason.** The
key I used as its control (`minutesSignatures`) belonged to the round being
deployed, so control and subject read 0 together and the reading said
nothing about either. Re-run with a key that went live this morning
(`peopleInRoom` → 1) and an invented one (→ 0), it discriminates: before the
build landed the subject read 0 with the control at 1, and after it, 1.

**What was verified against real renderers rather than asserted.** The Word
file was opened in **Word 16 through COM** and exported to PDF: 3 pages,
page setup 52/24/20mm, one **floating** header shape 595×842pt, and the
letterhead drawn on pages one and three. Two earlier shapes were measured
the same way and failed — an `<img>` in the header (inline; header a page
tall; **58 pages**) and `v:imagedata` with a data URI (floating, correctly
sized, **blank**). The printed PDF came from **headless Chrome**: the
sheet's bands at **0.0mm and 296.6mm** — the paper's own edges — with the
first line at **57.7mm** under a 52mm header, on pages one and three. The
anchor that forced the design was measured too: a fixed box under a 52mm
page margin lands at **52.2mm** (the page AREA, not the paper) and repeats,
while the same box at `top:-52mm` lands at **221.3mm** and does not repeat
at all.

NOT exercised live, and why: no letterhead has been uploaded to production —
that is an org-wide write on real data, and the whole path is proven against
fixtures, Word and a real print instead. The assistant's draft spends a
provider run, so it waits for a real press.

## 7r. Deployment record — 2026-09-17, later (5a2807a: db/0229 the signatures, core + web — the minutes are signed by the people in the room)

Migration first, then core on Hetzner, then the push (Vercel). 0229 applied on
production and the fixture suite re-run there — «the wall holds», **77 PASS**,
with **132_the_minutes_are_signed (29 checks)**, **50_identity_search_gateway
(30)** (the closed DELETE list grew its two argued entries) and **102_purge_
coverage (3)** (the purge learned both tables) among them. Locally the same
132 was flipped twice — an admin reading a colleague's signature on file, an
outsider signing — and went red by name each time, with the control green
either side.

Core: archive hashes equal end to end (`67c765ca65f1236a`), both entrypoints
parse under strip-types, both units active, health `{"ok":true}`, **zero**
level≥warning journal lines after the restart. The six new routes read **401**
signed out — `GET`/`PUT` `/v1/me/signature`, `GET`/`POST` `/v1/meetings/:id/
signatures`, `DELETE …/signatures/me`, `GET …/signatures/:userId/image` —
against `GET /v1/nonsense/signature` **404**. The BFF, read cache-busted from
outside **90 s** after the push: `/api/me/signature` went **404 → 401** (the
route did not exist before this build, so the flip IS the deploy marker), the
meeting routes 401, an empty POST body **400** and a real one **401** (the
2026-09-04 pair), the control 404.

**Read on production in the user's Chrome.** The summary tab of Sina's meeting
carries a FIFTH section «۵. امضای حاضران» as the last section inside the card
(23 px above the card's foot), reading «هنوز کسی امضا نکرده است.» with **no
control** — and that absence is the policy answering, not a gap: the server's
own record says `can_sign: false`, because the signed-in owner is neither the
host (Sina) nor on the roster. Being the org owner buys nothing here, which is
the design. The profile's identity section carries «امضا» directly under the
photo: a white 136×45 well reading «ثبت نشده», the camera badge at **26 px**
(= the photo's), no trash — the empty state, since `/api/me/signature` answers
404 for this account.

NOT exercised live, and why: every write. Signing, withdrawing and uploading a
signature are writes on the organisation's own records, and this org holds
two meetings, neither hosted by nor including the signed-in account — so the
positive half (the control drawn for a host; a picture landing in the
document's row) is pinned by the unit matrix (eleven mutations red, control
green) and by 132 on the fixture, and the first real signing is the screen's
own proof. Word's rendering of a body data-URI image was measured on the
letterhead round (7q) and is relied on here rather than re-measured.

## 7s. Deployment record — 2026-09-17, later (c5517f6 + 1131d07: web only — the front end unified at the CLASS, and the summary's ladder)

Nothing in core or db. Two pushes, Vercel only; each read back on
production in the user's Chrome (tab 842554675, app.neurai.pt) rather than
assumed from the push.

**c5517f6 — every button wears a kit coat, every heading a kit role.** The
disconnect the user reported was MEASURED first: a same-origin iframe walk
over 22 signed-in pages at 1280 (computed styles per control, grouped into
signatures — fire-and-forget into `window.__audit` and polled, because CDP's
`Runtime.evaluate` times out at 45 s and the walk took ~5 min) plus a source
census. It sat one property below the kit: cards, rails and fields were
already one recipe each; BUTTONS had two secondaries (51 outlined by hand
against 59 filled `.btn-secondary`, and the dialog kit's own `FOOTER_CANCEL`
outlined), 25 hand-drawn green primaries with a shadow and a heavier weight,
44 icon buttons with private hover grounds — 278 sites in 133 spellings;
HEADINGS in 46 spellings across 107; the new-task dialog carried TWO field
heights (42 vs 38); and the meeting page's tab rail measured 50 px against
40 everywhere else — `scroll-quiet`'s `scrollbar-width: thin`, which Chrome
honours natively on an overflowing horizontal box and which takes ~10 px of
layout. Fixed at the class: seven coats in `globals.css` (`btn-primary`,
`btn-secondary`, `btn-ghost`, `btn-danger`, and the three the screens had
been drawing by hand — `btn-soft`, `btn-dashed`, `btn-ghost-danger`), five
heading roles (`h-page` 16/700, `h-dialog` 15/700, `h-section` 15/600,
`h-card` 14/600, `h-label` 11/600 subtle), `PANEL_INPUT` on `.input`'s one
height, `.track-scroll` (no scrollbar at all) on both rails, and
`PanelHeader` deleted. 178 button sites in 63 files and 68 headings in 37
files moved by codemod; two guards refuse the hand-drawn spellings tree-wide
(`buttonCoat.guard`, `heading.guard`), each with a control proving it can
answer NO and verify-red by mutation.

Deploy check for c5517f6 was cache-busted through a class that exists ONLY
in the new build (`track-scroll`), with a both-builds control (`scroll-quiet`,
found in each) and an invented-class control (found in neither) — a marker
from the previous commit reports "deployed" on the first attempt, and one
with no subject reports nothing. **Read on production**: the meeting page's
two rails **40 / 40** (the tab rail had been 50); the summary tab's title on
`h-section` and its sections on `h-card`, its buttons `btn-secondary` /
`btn-soft`; the new-task dialog's title `h-dialog` at **14.1 / 700**, its
fields **38 / 38** on an 11 px corner, its footer «انصراف» `btn-secondary`
(40 px, `rgb(237,234,227)`, no border, weight 500) beside «ساختن تسک»
`btn-primary` (40 px, `rgb(1,116,63)`), its column chips 32 px on a
0.67 px edge.

**1131d07 — the summary's headings step DOWN.** The reading above found
the next one: inside section 2 the models' own «**Next steps**» rendered
at **17.8 / 700** ABOVE the card's numbered sections at 13.2 / 600 —
`SummaryBody.tsx` and `markdown.tsx` had been EXCEPTED from the heading
guard that afternoon as "content that scales with its prose", and content
inside a card with headings of its own is chrome. Every rung wore a legal
role, so no guard could see a ladder that climbs as it descends. The ladder
now: name `h-page` → numbered sections `h-section` → the prose's own
headings `h-card` (SummaryBody's, and markdown's top level) → markdown's
lower levels `h-label`; both renderers left the exception list (three files
remain), and the guard's first run on the tightened corpus named markdown's
`<h3>` at `text-sm font-semibold` before any green. `Summary.test` pins the
ORDER of roles on the rendered tab — three flattenings each red on its own
line — because a flattened ladder is spelled legally and only a rendered
test refuses it. The build gate's stricter typecheck caught a destructured
`HTMLElement | undefined` that `tsc` had passed (`?? null`).

Verified before the push: web tsc 0; 1795 web tests in 247 files (the one
red is the recorded `selectMenuWidth` load flake — 3.05 s under the full
suite, 5/5 alone); the build gate alone; the encoding sweep (1534 files);
verify-red by mutation on the guard (four reds by name) and on the ladder
test (three). Vercel: `neurai-site` completed at once, `mvp` building at the
time of writing; the production reading of 1131d07 follows below.

**Read on production (1131d07)**, both Vercel projects `success` on the
commit status, `/fa/meetings/c68e7943-…` → «خلاصه», at 1280 / root
15.06: the document's name `<h2>` on **`h-page` 15.1 / 700** (that class
on that element exists only in this build — the deploy marker), the five
numbered sections on **`h-section` 14.1 / 600**, and inside section 2 the
prose's own «تصمیم‌ها» and «اقدامات بعدی» on **`h-card` 13.2 / 600** —
one step UNDER the section they sit in, where the previous build had them
at 1.18 em bold above it. Eight headings on the tab, every one wearing a
kit role, none spelling a size. NOT exercised live: nothing — this round
is read-only on the org's data.

## 8. What never goes in this file (or any log)

Connection strings, DB passwords, API keys, service keys, JWT secrets, the
contents of `/etc/neurai/*.env`, or any customer content. When a command might
surface a URL in an error, pipe through
`sed -E 's#postgres(ql)?://[^ ]+#[redacted]#g'`.
